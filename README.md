This project aims to improve the experience of starting a browser with a visually pleasing interface featuring all the best bookmarks, and also being a bridge for easy sharing those bookmarks to other people.

All data is fetched from a json file, ensuring the maintenance process is easier, which can easily added throught the `add-links.sh` script, that uses `jq` for that.
